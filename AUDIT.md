# About **Rolling Dutch Auction**

The Rolling Dutch Auction protocol is a dutch auction derivative with composite decay. This means that the auction will start off with a high asking price and it will gradually be decreased with time. The protocol works by auctioning ERC20 tokens that can be bid on with other ERC20 tokens themselves. Both the auction and bid implementations are custodial, meaning the protocol is transferring and holding ERC20 funds in itself.

The way the auction works is by having windows, which are periods where the current price is frozen. Anytime a bid is submitted while a window is active, the duration of the window is restarted, meaning it implements a perpetual duration mechanism. When a window expires the current selling price is referenced by calculating the time elapsed from the last window instead of the auction's initiation.

## Unexpected/Interesting Design choices

The `withdraw` functionality is callable by anyone, it will transfer the proceeds and the remaining reserves to the `operatorAddress`. Same for `redeem`, anyone can call it and it will transfer the refund and claim amount to the `bidder` argument.

To overbid another bidder, you have to place a bid that has both a higher `price` and higher `volume` than the preceding highest bid.

Both the `scalarPrice` method and the `price` parameter in `commitBid` are valued in terms of the `reserve` token.

# Threat Model

## Roles & Actors

- Auction creator - an account that calls `createAuction` and loads the initial reserve into the `RDA` contract
- Auction operator - the account that will receive the proceeds & remaining reserves when `withdraw` is called
- Bidder - an account that submits a bid via the `commitBid` functionality, moving his `purchaseToken` funds into the `RDA` contract
- Unauthorized user - anyone can call `fulfillWindow`, `withdraw` and `redeem` by just paying gas

## Security Interview

**Q:** What in the protocol has value in the market?

**A:** The protocol is custodial, so the purchase and reserve tokens amounts it holds are valuable.

**Q:** What is the worst thing that can happen to the protocol?

**A:** The funds it holds get stuck in it forever or a user steals them, making other users' redeems/withdraws revert.

**Q:** In what case can the protocol/users lose money?

**A:** If users receive less (or none at all) reserve tokens than what they bid for. Same for the protocol operator - if he receives less (or none at all) purchase tokens than what he should have.

## Potential attacker's goals

- Place any method in the protocol into a state of DoS
- Steal another user's claimable reserve tokens
- Exploit bugs in price calculations

## Potential ways for the attacker to achieve his goals

- Making calls to `createAuction`, `commitBid`, `redeem` and `withdraw` revert by force-failing a `require` statement or an external call
- Exploit errors or rounding downs in divisions in price calculations for personal benefit
- Force the auction to never complete so no one will receive tokens

# Detailed Findings

# [C-01][x]  Anyone can make new bids always revert after a window expires

## Severity

**Impact:**
High, as all new bidding will revert until auction ends

**Likelihood:**
High, as anyone can execute the attack without rare preconditions

## Description

The `fulfillWindow` method is a `public` method that is also called internally. It sets `window.processed` to `true`, which makes it callable only once for a single `windowId`. The problem is that the `commitBid` function has the following logic:

```solidity
if (hasExpired) {
    window = _window[auctionId][windowExpiration(auctionId)];
}
```

Where `windowExpiration` calls `fulfillWindow` with the latest `windowId` in itself. If any user manages to call `fulfilWindow` externally first, then the `window.processed` will be set to `true`, making the following check in `fulfillWindow`

```solidity
if (window.processed) {
    revert WindowFulfilled();
}
```

revert on every `commitBid` call from now on. This will result in inability for anyone to place more bids, so the auction will not sell anything more until the end of the auction period.

## Recommendations

Make `fulfillWindow` to be `internal` and then add a new public method that calls it internally but also has the `inactiveAuction` modifier as well - this way anyone will be able to complete a window when an auction is finished even though no one can call `commitBid`.

# [C-02][x] Successful bidders can lose significant value due to division rounding

## Severity

**Impact:**
High, as possibly significant value will be lost

**Likelihood:**
High, as it will happen with most bids

## Description

The `fulfillWindow` method calculates the auction reserves and proceeds after a successful bid in a window. Here is how it accounts it in both the `auctions` and `claims` storage mappings:

```solidity
_auctions[auctionId].reserves -= volume / price;
_auctions[auctionId].proceeds += volume;

_claims[bidder][auctionId] = abi.encode(refund - volume, claim + (volume / price));
```

The problem is in the `volume / price` division and the way Solidity works - since it only has integers, in division the result is always rounded down. This would mean the bidder will have less `claim` tokens than expected, while the `_auctions[auctionId].reserves` will keep more tokens than it should have. Let's look at the following scenario:

1. The `reserve` token is `WETH` (18 decimals) and the purchase token is `DAI` - 18 decimals as well
2. Highest bidder in the window bid 2 \* 1e18 - 1 `DAI` with a price of 1e18 `WETH`
3. While the bid should have resulted in 1.99999 `WETH` bought, the user will receive only 1 `WETH` but not get a refund here
4. The user got the same amount of `WETH` as if he bid 1e18 but he bid twice as much, minus one

Every remainder of the `volume / price` division will result in a loss for the bidder.

## Recommendations

Design the code so that the remainder of the `volume / price` division gets refunded to the bidder, for example adding it to the `refund` value.

# [C-03][x] The logic in `elapsedTime` is flawed

## Severity

**Impact:**
High, as the method is used to calculate the price of the auction but will give out wrong results

**Likelihood:**
High, as the problems are present almost all of the time during an auction

## Description

There are multiple flaws with the `elapsedTime` method:

1. If there are 0 windows, the `windowIndex` variable (which is used for the windows count) will be 1, which is wrong and will lead to a big value for `windowElapsedTime` when it should be 0
2. If `auctionElapsedTime == windowElapsedTime` we will get `auctionElapsedTime` as a result, but if there was just 1 more second in `auctionElapsedTime` we would get `auctionElapsedTime - windowElapsedTime` which would be 1 as a result, so totally different result
3. When a window is active, the `timestamp` argument will have the same value as the `auction.startTimestamp` so `auctionElapsedTime` will always be 0 in this case

The method has multiple flaws and works only in the happy-case scenario.

## Recommendations

Remove the method altogether or extract two methods out of it, removing the `timestamp` parameter to simplify the logic. Also think about the edge case scenarios.

# [H-01][x] Users are likely to lose their bid if `purchaseToken` is a low-decimals token

## Severity

**Impact:**
High, because users will lose their entire bid amount

**Likelihood:**
Medium, because it happens when `purchaseToken` is a low-decimals token, but those are commonly used

## Description

When a user calls `commitBid` he provides a `volume` parameter, which is the amount of `purchaseToken` he will bid, and a `price` parameter, which is the price in `reserveToken`. His bid is then cached and when window expires the `fulfillWindow` method is called, where we have this logic:

```solidity
_auctions[auctionId].reserves -= volume / price;
_auctions[auctionId].proceeds += volume;

_claims[bidder][auctionId] = abi.encode(refund - volume, claim + (volume / price));
```

The problem lies in the `volume / price` calculation. In the case that the `reserveToken` is a 18 decimal token (most common ones) but the `purchaseToken` has a low decimals count - `USDC`, `USDT` and `WBTC` have 6 to 8 decimals, then it's very likely that the `volume / price` calculation will result in rounding down to 0. This means that the auction owner would still get the whole bid amount, but the bidder will get 0 `reserveToken`s to claim, resulting in a total loss of his bid.

The issue is also present when you are using same decimals tokens for both `reserve` and `purchase` tokens but the `volume` in a bid is less than the `price`. Again, the division will round down to zero, resulting in a 100% loss for the bidder.

## Recommendations

In `commitBid` enforce that `volume >= price` and in `createAuction` enforce that the `reserveToken` decimals are equal to the `purchaseToken` decimals.

# [M-01][x] Missing input validation on `createAuction` function parameters can lead to loss of value

## Severity

**Impact:**
High, as it can lead to stuck funds

**Likelihood:**
Low, as it requires user error/misconfiguration

## Description

There are some problems with the input validation in `createAuction`, more specifically related to the timestamp values.

1. `endTimestamp` can be equal to `startTimestamp`, so `duration` will be 0
2. `endTimestamp` can be much further in the future than `startTimestamp`, so `duration` will be a huge number and the auction may never end
3. Both `startTimestamp` and `endTimestamp` can be much further in the future, so auction might never start

Those possibilities should all be mitigated, as they can lead to the initial reserves and/or the bids being stuck in the protocol forever.

## Recommendations

Use a minimal `duration` value, for example 1 day, as well as a max value, for example 20 days. Make sure auction does not start more than X days after it has been created as well.

# [M-02][x] Loss of precision in `scalarPrice` function

## Severity

**Impact:**
Medium, as the price will not be very far from the expected one

**Likelihood:**
Medium, as it will not always result in big loss of precision

## Description

In `scalarPrice` there is this code:

```solidity
uint256 b_18 = 1e18;
uint256 t_mod = t % (t_r - t);
uint256 x = (t + t_mod) * b_18 / t_r;
uint256 y = !isInitialised ? state.price : window.price;

return y - (y * x) / b_18;
```

Here, when you calculate `x` you divide by `t_r` even though later you multiply `x` by `y`. To minimize loss of precision you should always do multiplications before divisions, since solidity just rounds down when there is a remainder in the division operation.

## Recommendations

Always do multiplications before divisions in Solidity, make sure to follow this throughout the whole `scalarPrice` method.

# [M-03] Protocol won't work correctly with tokens that do not revert on failed `transfer`

## Severity

**Impact:**
High, as it can lead to a loss of value

**Likelihood:**
Low, as such tokens are not so common

## Description

Some tokens do not revert on failure in `transfer` or `transferFrom` but instead return `false` (example is [ZRX](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#code)). While such tokens are technically compliant with the standard it is a common issue to forget to check the return value of the `transfer`/`transferFrom` calls. With the current code, if such a call fails but does not revert it will result in inaccurate calculations or funds stuck in the protocol.

## Recommendations

Use OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20` library and its `safe` methods for ERC20 transfers.

# [M-04] Auction won't work correctly with fee-on-transfer & rebasing tokens

## Severity

**Impact:**
High, as it can lead to a loss of value

**Likelihood:**
Low, as such tokens are not so common

## Description

The code in `createAuction` does the following:

```solidity
IERC20(reserveToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), reserveAmount);
...
...
state.reserves = reserveAmount;
```

so it basically caches the expected transferred amount. This will not work if the `reserveToken` has a fee-on-transfer mechanism, since the actual received amount will be less because of the fee. It is also a problem if the token used had a rebasing mechanism, as this can mean that the contract will hold less balance than what it cached in `state.reserves` for the auction, or it will hold more, which will be stuck in the protocol.

## Recommendations

You can either explicitly document that you do not support tokens with a fee-on-transfer or rebasing mechanisms or you can do the following:

1. For fee-on-transfer tokens, check the balance before and after the transfer and use the difference as the actual amount received
2. For rebasing tokens, when they go down in value, you should have a method to update the cached `reserves` accordingly, based on the balance held. This is a complex solution
3. For rebasing tokens, when they go up in value, you should add a method to actually transfer the excess tokens out of the protocol.

# [L-01] Auction with `price == 0` can be re-created

The `createAuction` method checks if auction exists with this code

```solidity
Auction storage state = _auctions[auctionId];

if (state.price != 0) {
    revert AuctionExists();
}
```

But the method does not check if the `startingOriginPrice` argument had a value of 0 - if it did, then `state.price` would be 0 in the next `createAuction` call. Even though this is not expected to happen, if it does it can lead to this line of code being executed twice:

```solidity
IERC20(reserveToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), reserveAmount);
```

which will result in a loss for the caller. Make sure to require that the value of `startingOriginPrice` is not 0.

# [L-02][x] The `commitBid` method does not follow Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern

It's a best practice to follow the CEI pattern in methods that do value transfers. Still, it is not always the best solution, as ERC777 tokens can still reenter while the contract is in a strange state even if you follow CEI. I would recommend adding a `nonReentrant` modifier to `commitBid` and also moving the `transferFrom` call to the end of the method.

# [L-03][x] The `scalarPrice` method should have an `activeAuction` modifier

If an auction is inactive then the `scalarPrice` method will still be returning a price, even though it should not, since auction is over. Add the `activeAuction` modifier to it.

# [I-01] Using `require` statements without error strings

The `activeAuction` and `inactiveAuction` modifiers use `require` statements without error strings. Use `if` statements with custom errors instead for a better error case UX.

# [I-02] Typos in code

Fix all typos in the code:

`Ancoded` -> `Encoded`

`exipration` -> `expiration`

`fuflfillment` -> `fulfillment`

`operatorAdress` -> `operatorAddress`

`Uinx` -> `Unix`

`multipled` -> `multiplied`

the `expiryTimestamp > 0` check in `remainingWindowTime` is redundant

# [I-03] Missing License identifier

The `RDA.sol` file is missing License Identifier as the first line of the file, which is a compiler warning. Add the `No License` License at least to remove the compiler warning.

# [I-04] Function state mutability can be restricted to view

The `scalarPriceUint` method does not mutate state but is not marked as `view` - add the `view` keyword to the function's signature.

# [I-05] Incomplete NatSpec docs

Methods have incomplete NatSpec docs, for example the `elapsedTime` method is missing the `@param timestamp` in its NatSpec, and also most methods are missing the `@return` param - for example `balancesOf` and `createAuction`. Make sure to write complete and detailed NatSpec docs for each public method.

# [I-06] Missing `override` keyword

The `createAuction`, `withdraw` and `redeem` methods are missing the `override` keyword even though the override methods from the `IRDA` interface. Add it to the mentioned methods.
